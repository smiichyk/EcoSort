        <h1>Ireland's Recycling Revolution</h1>
        <p>Explore Ireland's journey in waste reduction and environmental protection. From groundbreaking initiatives like the plastic bag levy to the recent Deposit Return Scheme, Ireland continues to innovate in recycling and sustainability.</p>

    <section class="main_margin" id="plastic_bag_levy">
      <h2>Plastic Bag Levy</h2>
      <p>In 2002, Ireland became the first country in the world to introduce a plastic bag levy, charging consumers 15 cents per plastic bag. This initiative resulted in an immediate reduction of over 90% in plastic bag usage, encouraging retailers to transition to paper bags and prompting consumers to bring their own bags while shopping.</p>
      <p>However, there have been signs of complacency, with reports indicating that plastic bag consumption had risen to 33 bags per capita. To combat this trend, the levy was increased to 22 cents in July 2006.</p>

        <h2>Deposit Return Scheme</h2>
        <div class="flexbox_container">
          <p>In 2024, Ireland introduced a nationwide Deposit Return Scheme (DRS) to reduce plastic waste and promote a circular economy. Under this scheme, consumers pay a small deposit when purchasing beverages in plastic bottles or cans, which is refundable upon returning the empty containers to designated return points, typically found in supermarkets or collection centers. Containers eligible for return are marked with a distinctive <em>Re-turn logo</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This system encourages recycling by providing a financial incentive for consumers to return used bottles and cans instead of discarding them.

    <section id="repak">
      <h2>Repak</h2>
      <p>Ireland's DRS aligns with similar successful programs across Europe, aiming for improved recycling rates and reduced litter. The initiative supports the goals of Repak, a non-profit organization established in 1997 to manage packaging recycling and enhance recycling rates in Ireland.</p>
      <div class="flexbox_container">
        <img src="img/logos/repak_logo.png" height="50" alt="Repak Logo">
        <div>
          <p>Repak collaborates with businesses to help them comply with packaging waste legislation and aims to increase the volume of recycled and reused packaging materials, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability. For more information, visit the <a href="https://repak.ie/">Repak website</a>.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>To promote recycling, Repak implements various programs, including public education on recycling, convenient collection points for packaging, and support for companies in reducing their overall packaging usage. Through these efforts, Ireland hopes to achieve higher quality recycling and mitigate the environmental impact of single-use plastics.</p>

        <h2>WEEE</h2>
        <div class="flexbox_container">
          <p>In August 2005, Ireland implemented the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive into its legislation. This law mandates that retailers of electrical products offer a free in-store take-back service for old electrical items when customers buy new equipment. The costs associated with this service are ultimately borne by consumers.</p>
